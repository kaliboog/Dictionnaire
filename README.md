# Dictionnaire

This repository contains an offline vocabulary explorer for French sounds.
It now bundles an [eSpeak](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng) WebAssembly build to
provide offline French text‑to‑speech for each word.

## Deploying on Netlify

Netlify will automatically serve the `index.html` file at the root of the repository. The included `netlify.toml` configures Netlify to publish the root directory without any build step.
